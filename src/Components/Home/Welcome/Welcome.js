          Yoga is not a religion, it is a way of living that aims towards a
          healthy mind in a healthy body. <br />
          Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being; yoga helps promote a
          balanced development of all the three. Other forms of physical
          exercises, like aerobics, assure only physical well-being. They have
          little to do with the development of the spiritual or astral body.
          <br />
          The art of practicing yoga helps in controlling an individualâ€™s mind,
          body and soul. It brings together physical and mental disciplines to
          achieve a peaceful body and mind; it helps manage stress and anxiety
          and keeps you relaxing.
